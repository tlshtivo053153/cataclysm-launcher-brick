# Task Summary: Refactoring and Process Improvement

## 1. Goal
To improve the long-term maintainability and robustness of the codebase by refactoring key modules and establishing better development practices.

## 2. Key Activities

### 2.1. `GameManager` Refactoring
-   **Problem:** The `GameManager` module had accumulated multiple responsibilities, including game logic, file system operations, and archive handling, making it difficult to maintain and test.
-   **Solution:**
    1.  **Separation of Concerns:** A new `src/FileSystemUtils.hs` module was created. Generic, reusable functions (`findCommonPrefix`, `findFilesRecursively`, `isSafePath`) were moved from `GameManager` to this new module.
    2.  **Type-Safe Errors:** The error handling, which previously relied on `Either String`, was upgraded. A custom `ManagerError` algebraic data type was introduced in `src/Types.hs` to represent different classes of errors (Network, FileSystem, Archive, etc.), making error handling more explicit and robust.
    3.  **Module Updates:** `GameManager`, `app/Main.hs`, and the test suite were updated to use the new `FileSystemUtils` module and the `ManagerError` type.

### 2.2. Addressing Corrupted Japanese Characters
-   **Problem:** It was identified that my file writing operations were repeatedly causing Mojibake (garbled text) for Japanese characters in task files.
-   **Root Cause:** A flaw in my internal file writing process, likely related to incorrect character encoding handling.
-   **Solution:** A new "Data Integrity Protocol" was formally defined. This protocol mandates a write-verify-correct cycle for any file operation involving non-ASCII text.

### 2.3. Updating Development Guidelines (`GEMINI.md`)
-   **Problem:** The lessons learned from the debugging and refactoring cycles were not captured, risking a repeat of the same mistakes.
-   **Solution:** The `GEMINI.md` file was updated with new, specific rules derived directly from the recent challenges:
    -   A "Self-Accountability Principle" to check my own changes first when debugging.
    -   An "Execution Context Normalization" rule mandating the use of absolute paths and proper handling of asynchronous UI results.
    -   A "Stepwise Refinement Principle" encouraging proactive refactoring.
    -   The "Data Integrity Protocol" to prevent future character encoding issues.

## 3. Outcome
-   The codebase is now better structured, with clearer separation of responsibilities.
-   Error handling is more robust and type-safe.
-   The development process itself has been improved by formally documenting lessons learned, reducing the likelihood of repeating past errors.
