# Task Summary: Bug Fixing and Core Feature Stabilization

## 1. Initial Problem
The work started with a critical bug where downloaded `.tar.gz` archives failed to extract, preventing game installation. This was documented in `task/20250630_resume.md`.

## 2. Debugging and Resolution Cycle

This phase involved a highly iterative cycle of identifying a problem, proposing a fix, compiling, and testing.

### 2.1. Archive Extraction (`NotTarFormat` Error)
-   **Symptom:** `NotTarFormat` error during extraction.
-   **Root Cause:** The downloaded file was a `.tar.gz` archive, but the code was attempting to read it as a plain `.tar` file without decompressing it first.
-   **Fix:** Added `Codec.Compression.GZip.decompress` to the `extractTar` function in `GameManager.hs` before processing the tar entries.

### 2.2. Permissions Failure
-   **Symptom:** Game files were extracted, but the main executables (`cataclysm-launcher`, `cataclysm-tiles`) did not have execute permissions.
-   **Root Cause:** The initial `setPermissions` logic assumed the executables would be in the top-level directory of the installation path. It did not account for archives that contain a single root folder (e.g., `cataclysmdda-0.G/`).
-   **Fix:** Replaced the simple permission setting logic with a new `findFilesRecursively` helper function. This function traverses the entire installation directory to find the executables wherever they are and then applies the correct permissions.

### 2.3. Game Launch Failure (`Executable not found`)
-   **Symptom:** The launcher could not find the executable to run, even after permissions were fixed.
-   **Root Cause:** Similar to the permissions issue, the `launchGame` function was hardcoded to look for the executable only in the top-level installation directory.
-   **Fix:** Modified `launchGame` to use the same `findFilesRecursively` helper, ensuring it could locate and run the executable from the correct subdirectory.

### 2.4. Silent Launch Failure (Race Condition)
-   **Symptom:** The game would not launch, and no error message was displayed in the UI.
-   **Root Cause:** The `launchGame` function was being called in a separate thread (`forkIO`), but the main UI thread was immediately terminated (`halt`). This created a race condition where the application would exit before the game process could be created.
-   **Fix:**
    1.  Removed the `forkIO` from the launch process, making it a synchronous, blocking call.
    2.  Modified `launchGame` to return an `Either ManagerError ()`.
    3.  Updated the UI event handler in `app/Main.hs` to only `halt` on success and to display an error message in the status bar on failure.

### 2.5. Path Issues (`execvp: does not exist`)
-   **Symptom:** The OS could not find the executable file even with the correct path string.
-   **Root Cause:** The application was using relative paths (e.g., `./.cataclysm-launcher-brick/...`). This is unreliable as it depends on the directory from which the launcher is executed.
-   **Fix:** Modified `getInstalledVersions` in `GameManager.hs` to use `makeAbsolute`, ensuring all internal paths to game installations are absolute paths.

## 3. Outcome
Through this multi-step debugging process, the core functionality of the launcher—downloading, installing, and launching games—was made robust and reliable.
