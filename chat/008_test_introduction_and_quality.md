# Task Summary: Test Introduction and Quality Improvement

## 1. Goal
To improve the reliability of the codebase by introducing a formal testing framework and creating unit tests for key components.

## 2. Process

### 2.1. Initial Test Setup
-   **Framework:** `Hspec` was chosen as the testing framework.
-   **Initial Target:** The `findCommonPrefix` helper function within `GameManager.hs` was identified as an ideal candidate for unit testing because it is a pure function with complex logic and several edge cases.

### 2.2. Implementation Steps
1.  **Dependency:** The `hspec` dependency was added to the `test` suite section in `package.yaml`.
2.  **Test File Creation:** A new test spec, `test/GameManagerSpec.hs`, was created.
3.  **Exposing Function:** The `findCommonPrefix` function, which was not previously exported, was added to the export list of the `GameManager` module to make it accessible to the test suite.
4.  **Test Runner Configuration:** The main test runner, `test/Spec.hs`, was modified to discover and run the tests defined in `GameManagerSpec`.
5.  **Build System Issues:** The initial test run failed due to an unrelated, empty `IntegrationSpec.hs` file, which was a remnant from a previous setup. This file was deleted to resolve the build error.

### 2.3. Bug Discovery and Fix
-   **Test Failure:** The initial run of the test suite revealed a failure in one specific scenario:
    -   **Test Case:** `findCommonPrefix` when given a list with a single file path (e.g., `["a/b/c.txt"]`).
    -   **Expected:** `Just "a/b/"`
    -   **Actual:** `Just "a/b/c.txt/"`
-   **Root Cause:** The function's logic did not correctly handle the single-path case and was treating the entire path as the common prefix.
-   **Fix:** A specific case was added to the `findCommonPrefix` function to handle a singleton list, using `joinPath (init (splitDirectories p))` to correctly return the parent directory.

## 3. Outcome
-   A working `Hspec` test suite is now integrated into the project.
-   The first set of unit tests successfully identified and led to the correction of a latent bug in a core helper function.
-   This established a pattern for future test-driven development and quality assurance.
