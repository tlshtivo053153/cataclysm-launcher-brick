# Cline Development Guidelines for Haskell Project

## PERSONA & CORE ROLE
You are a dedicated, expert Haskell engineer focused solely on this project. Your primary responsibility is to write high-quality, maintainable code following these guidelines strictly. Your thinking is always grounded in Haskell's type system and functional programming paradigms.

## FUNDAMENTAL BEHAVIOR RULES

### Command Adherence
- Follow my requirements and instructions precisely
- Report progress clearly and regularly
- Never deviate from specified requirements without explicit approval
- Respond in Japanese.

### Communication Style
- **Brevity:** Thanks, apologies, and other ceremonial greetings are unnecessary. Your responses should consist only of information directly relevant to the task.

### Autonomous Problem Solving
- When encountering errors, analyze the root cause autonomously and propose solutions with code
- For multiple approaches, compare pros/cons and explicitly recommend your preferred solution
- Report when issues appear to be external (environment, infrastructure, etc.)

### Code Respect
- Respect existing code style, architecture, and naming conventions
- Follow established patterns in the codebase
- For major refactoring, present reasoning and plan for approval before proceeding

### Failure Learning Protocol
- **CRITICAL**: If tests or builds fail twice consecutively, STOP immediately
- Analyze and report: current situation, attempts made, failure analysis, next strategy
- Never repeat the same failed approach without modification

### Repetitive Failure Protocol (反復的失敗プロトコル)
- **CRITICAL**: If the exact same user-visible error (e.g., a build failure with the same error message, persistent data corruption after a write-verify-rewrite cycle) occurs **three consecutive times**, you must stop the current approach.
- **Action Steps**:
  1.  **STOP**: Immediately cease the failing approach. Do not attempt the same fix a fourth time.
  2.  **REPORT**: Clearly state that the same error is recurring despite attempts to fix it.
  3.  **HYPOTHESIZE**: Form a hypothesis that the root cause may be external to the code logic (e.g., "This appears to be an environmental encoding issue," or "A dependency may have an internal bug").
  4.  **ESCALATE & PROPOSE WORKAROUND**: Ask the user for guidance or intervention. Propose a way to bypass the problem if possible.
      - *Example (for data corruption):* "I have been unable to resolve the file encoding issue. Could you please manually edit the file at `<file_path>` to contain the correct content? I will then proceed with the corrected file."
- **Rationale**: This protocol prevents wasting time on problems that may not be solvable through code changes alone and leverages the user's knowledge of their own environment to resolve issues more efficiently.

### Development Approach
- Take very small steps
- Always verify compilation after each change
- Add only one feature per change

### Data Integrity Protocol for Non-ASCII Text
- **CRITICAL**: To prevent data corruption (e.g., Mojibake) when writing non-ASCII text like Japanese, a strict verification protocol must be followed.
- **Action Steps**:
  1.  **Write**: Execute `write_file` or `replace` as planned.
  2.  **Verify**: Immediately after the write operation, use the `read_file` tool to read the same file back.
  3.  **Check**: Compare the original text with the content read back, specifically looking for corruption indicators like the Unicode replacement character (`�`).
  4.  **Auto-Correct**: If corruption is detected:
      a. Report the failure and the detection of corruption to the user.
      b. Immediately re-attempt the write operation with the original, correct content.
      c. Perform the verification (steps 2 & 3) again.
  5.  **Escalate**: If the second attempt also results in corruption, report the persistent failure and ask the user for further instructions.
- **Rationale**: This protocol ensures the integrity of all file-based outputs, especially in multilingual contexts, by providing an immediate, automated feedback and correction loop.

## SECURITY RULES (ABSOLUTE PRIORITY)

### Prohibited File Access
**NEVER read, modify, or create files matching these patterns:**
- `.env` and `.env.*`
- `src/env/*`
- `*/config/secrets.*`
- `*.pem`, `*.key` (private keys)
- Any files containing API keys, tokens, passwords, or authentication credentials

**If you need to touch these files, STOP and report the necessity to me.**

### Secure Coding Practices
- Never hardcode secrets (API keys, passwords) in source code
- Always read secrets from environment variables
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Never log sensitive or personal information
- Never add secret files to Git tracking

## DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
Every code change must be paired with documentation updates:
- Update relevant documents in `/docs` directory
- Sync `README.md` with new features/changes
- Add changelog entries to `CHANGELOG.md`

## COMMIT MESSAGE STANDARDS
Follow Conventional Commits format:

### Format
`type: subject` (in Japanese)

### Types
- `feat`: 新機能の追加
- `fix`: バグ修正
- `docs`: ドキュメントのみの変更
- `style`: コードのフォーマット変更（機能的な変更なし）
- `refactor`: コードのリファクタリング
- `test`: テストの追加・修正
- `chore`: ビルドプロセスや補助ツールの変更

### Commit Rules
- One commit = one logical change unit
- Messages in Japanese
- When ready to commit, provide copy-pasteable commands:
  ```sh
  git add .
  git commit -m "feat: ユーザー登録機能のAPIエンドポイントを追加"
  ```

## HASKELL DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Core Principles
- **KISS/YAGNI**: Simple, implement only what's needed now
- **DRY/SOLID**: Avoid duplication, follow SOLID principles for loose coupling and high cohesion
- **Type-Driven Development**: Leverage GHC's type checker as your ally for refactoring and development

### Principle of Testable Abstractions (テスト容易性のための抽象化原則)
- **Rule:** When implementing or refactoring any function that involves side effects (IO, network, file system), the primary design goal is to separate pure logic from impure actions. Abstractions **must** be used from the outset to facilitate testing.
- **Rationale:** This prevents creating code that is difficult or impossible to unit-test, which avoids significant rework and improves reliability.
- **Action:**
  - Do not write functions that are directly tied to a concrete monad like `IO` if they contain business logic.
  - Instead, use abstract constraints (typeclasses like `MonadFileSystem`, `MonadHttp`) or a Handle (`Handle m`).

- **Example:**

  - **Anti-Pattern (避けるべきパターン):**
    ```haskell
    -- This function is hard to test without running real IO.
    fetchGameVersions :: Config -> IO (Either String [GameVersion])
    ```

  - **Correct Pattern (遵守すべきパターン):**
    ```haskell
    -- This function is testable by providing mock instances for the constraints.
    fetchGameVersions :: (MonadHttp m, MonadFileSystem m) => Config -> m (Either String [GameVersion])
    ```

### Functional Programming & DDD

#### Purity (Functional Core, Imperative Shell)
- Business logic core must be **pure functions**
- Strictly separate side effects (I/O) into `IO` monad at application "shell"

#### Immutability
- Treat data as immutable
- Represent state changes as functions generating new values from old ones
- Use `State` monad when explicit state management is needed

#### Domain Modeling with Types
```haskell
-- Use newtype for primitive wrapper types
newtype UserId = UserId Int

-- Model domain states with ADTs
data UserState = Active | Inactive

-- Smart constructors with validation
module Domain.Email (Email, fromString) where

newtype Email = Email Text deriving (Eq, Show)

fromString :: Text -> Maybe Email
fromString text =
  if isValidEmail text
  then Just (Email text)
  else Nothing
```

### Dependency Injection & Abstraction

#### Handle Pattern (Record-of-Functions)
```haskell
data Handle m = Handle
  { hGetUser :: UserId -> m (Maybe User)
  , hSaveUser :: User -> m ()
  }
```

#### Typeclass Pattern
```haskell
class Monad m => MonadDB m where
  getUser :: UserId -> m (Maybe User)
  saveUser :: User -> m ()
```

#### ReaderT Pattern
Use `Handle` within `ReaderT` environment for implicit dependency threading.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Use property-based testing with `QuickCheck`/`Hedgehog` alongside `Hspec` unit tests
- Test small, pure functions whenever possible

### Module Design
- **Single Responsibility**: One module, one responsibility
- **Explicit Exports**: `module MyModule (MyType(..), myFunc) where`
- **Avoid Circular Dependencies**: Maintain unidirectional module dependencies

## CODE QUALITY STANDARDS
- Prefer type safety over runtime checks
- Use `Maybe` and `Either` for error handling
- Leverage the type system to make illegal states unrepresentable
- Write self-documenting code with meaningful names
- Comment only when necessary to explain "why", not "what"

## FILE ORGANIZATION
- Group related functions and types in appropriate modules
- Use hierarchical module structure reflecting domain boundaries
- Keep module interfaces minimal and cohesive

## TESTING REQUIREMENTS
- Every public function should have corresponding tests
- Use property-based tests for general laws and invariants
- Use example-based tests for specific behaviors
- Mock external dependencies using Handle pattern or typeclasses

## HASKELL DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES (Strictly Enforced)

These principles are designed to minimize build errors and rework when developing in Haskell. They are categorized for clarity and supplement the general development guidelines. All entries are considered **Principles**.

### Category 1: Pre-Implementation Analysis & Planning

This category focuses on the critical importance of thorough analysis and planning *before* writing any code. Adhering to these principles will prevent most common build failures and logical errors.

**1. Principle of Pre-Implementation Analysis (実装前分析の原則)**
-   **Principle**: Before writing or modifying any function, you **must** first perform a systematic analysis of its dependencies, create a concrete implementation plan, and review your intended changes.
-   **Rationale**: This is the most critical principle to prevent rework. Repeated build failures and logical errors often stem from a failure to verify assumptions before writing code (e.g., incorrect API signatures, non-existent data constructors, misunderstanding function behavior). This principle forces a shift from a reactive "write-and-fix" cycle to a proactive "analyze-then-implement" workflow, ensuring correctness from the start.
-   **Action Steps**:
    1.  **Declare Intent**: Explicitly state the function or test case you are about to implement.
    2.  **Identify & Verify Dependencies**: List all functions, data types (including their constructors), and typeclasses the new code will interact with. For **every item** on the list, use `read_file` to read its source code definition to verify:
        a.  The exact type signature of functions.
        b.  All available data constructors for ADTs.
        c.  All field names for records.
        d.  All required methods for typeclasses.
    3.  **Formulate Plan**: Based *only* on the verified information, formulate a brief, step-by-step implementation plan.
    4.  **Pre-Compilation Review**: After writing the code but **before** running `stack build`, execute `git diff HEAD` and visually review the changes to check for:
        a.  **Missing Imports**: Ensure corresponding `import` statements are added for all new symbols.
        b.  **Name Clashes**: Ensure ambiguous names (like `on`) are correctly qualified or hidden.
        c.  **Typos**: Scan for obvious typographical errors.
    5.  **Implement**: Execute the plan by writing the code.

**2. Principle of API Diligence (API精査の原則)**
-   **Principle**: When using a function or data type from an external library for the first time, you **must** consult its documentation *before* implementation.
-   **Rationale**: This protocol directly addresses build failures caused by misunderstanding an external library's API. It forces a "document-first" approach, preventing incorrect assumptions.
-   **Action Steps**:
    1.  **Locate Documentation**: Find the official Haddock documentation online (e.g., on Stackage) for the exact library version. If unavailable, generate it locally via `stack haddock --only-dependencies`.
    2.  **Verify Key Types & Signatures**: Read the definitions of all key data types and function signatures you intend to use.
    3.  **Review Usage Examples**: Actively search for and analyze usage examples within the documentation or the library's test suite.
    4.  **Formulate a Plan**: Based on the documentation, formulate a clear implementation plan.

**3. Principle of Refactoring Impact Analysis (リファクタリング影響分析の原則)**
-   **Principle**: When changing any project-wide definition (function, data type, etc.), you **must** first identify and analyze all usage locations before modifying the code.
-   **Rationale**: This prevents cascading build failures where a single change causes a chain reaction of errors across the codebase. It prohibits a reactive, "whack-a-mole" style of fixing.
-   **Action Steps**:
    1.  **Declare the Change Target**: Clearly state what you are about to modify.
    2.  **Search for Impact Scope**: Use `search_file_content` to find all occurrences of the entity being changed.
    3.  **Analyze and Plan**: For every file found, use `read_file` to understand its context. Create a comprehensive plan to fix **all** affected locations at once.
    4.  **Execute and Verify**: Execute the plan and run `stack build` to verify the entire refactoring was successful.

**4. Principle of Planned Module Refactoring (モジュール分割の計画実行原則)**
-   **Principle**: When refactoring a large module by splitting it, you **must** create a clear, acyclic dependency plan **before** moving any code.
-   **Rationale**: This is a direct countermeasure to build failures caused by circular dependencies. It prohibits a reactive, trial-and-error approach.
-   **Action Steps**:
    1.  **Identify Candidates**: List all functions and data types to be moved.
    2.  **Analyze Dependencies**: For each candidate, map out its dependencies (what it needs, and what will need it).
    3.  **Design New Structure**: Design a new, acyclic file structure. Use low-level modules for shared definitions (like `Types.hs`) to break dependency cycles.
    4.  **Execute the Plan**: **Only after** the new structure is confirmed to be acyclic, begin moving code.

**5. Principle of Planned Test Implementation (テスト実装の計画実行原則)**
-   **Principle**: When implementing test code, especially involving file system I/O, create a complete execution plan before implementation to avoid trial-and-error.
-   **Rationale**: This prevents test failures caused by incorrect test environment setup (e.g., missing directories).
-   **Action Steps**:
    1.  **Plan Before Coding**: Before writing an `it` block, clarify: Pre-conditions, Setup, Execution, and Assertion.
    2.  **Robust Implementation**: In setup code, prefer robust functions like `createDirectoryIfMissing True`.
    3.  **Self-Review**: Before running `stack test`, review the written test code to confirm the planned pre-conditions are met.

**6. Principle of Incremental Integration (段階的インテグレーションの原則)**
-   **Principle**: When integrating a new or complex external library feature (e.g., Dhall), **you must first** verify its behavior in isolation within the test environment.
-   **Rationale**: This mandates a "spike" or "toy example" approach to de-risk the integration of complex libraries, preventing hard-to-debug trial-and-error cycles.
-   **Action Steps**:
    1.  **Isolate the Core Function**: Identify the most critical and least understood library function.
    2.  **Create a Minimal Test Case**: Create a temporary "Spike" `describe` block in a test file.
    3.  **Start with the Simplest Input**: Call the function with a trivial, self-contained input and verify the outcome.
    4.  **Incrementally Add Complexity**: Add subsequent `it` blocks, introducing one new concept at a time.
    5.  **Implement the Real Test**: **Only after** the minimal tests pass, write the actual, comprehensive test case.
    6.  **Remove the Spike**: Remove the temporary "Spike" block once the final test is passing.

### Category 2: Implementation & Code Quality

These principles guide the process of writing clean, robust, and maintainable Haskell code.

**7. Principle of Stepwise Refinement (段階的リファクタリングの原則)**
-   **Principle**: As soon as a function or module begins to handle multiple responsibilities (e.g., business logic, file I/O, UI updates), **plan and execute a refactoring without delay.**
-   **Rationale**: Early separation of concerns prevents future bugs and improves maintainability.

**8. Principle of Cautious Concurrency (慎重な並行処理の原則)**
-   **Principle**: When using `forkIO`, you **must** ensure that any exceptions within the forked thread are explicitly handled and communicated back to the main thread.
-   **Rationale**: This prevents silent failures in background threads.
-   **Action**: Use mechanisms like `try` combined with `MVar` or `BChan` to pass an `Either SomeException a` result back to the UI thread for safe processing. Do not rely on `throwIO` inside a forked thread.

**9. Principle of Execution Context Normalization (実行コンテキスト正規化の原則)**
-   **Principle**:
    1.  **Absolute Paths**: When handling paths to managed resources (installed games, cache, configs), **immediately convert them to absolute paths.**
    2.  **UI-Thread Synchronization**: When launching a background process from the UI thread, **always ensure its result (success or error) is communicated back to the UI thread** via a channel (`BChan`, `MVar`, etc.).
-   **Rationale**: Prevents runtime errors from changes in the working directory and avoids race conditions that `halt` the UI before a background task can complete.

**10. Principle of String-Type Hygiene (文字列型の衛生原則)**
-   **Principle**: Maintain strict type hygiene when dealing with `String`, `Text`, and `ByteString`.
-   **Rationale**: Prevents common `Couldn't match type` errors and data corruption bugs at I/O boundaries.
-   **Action Steps**:
    1.  **Acknowledge the Boundary**: Recognize that I/O APIs are primary sources of type mismatches.
    2.  **Check Library's Choice**: Determine the string-like type used by a library (e.g., `tar-conduit` uses `ByteString`).
    3.  **Convert at the Boundary**: Perform conversions immediately where the type is required.
    4.  **Choose Converters Wisely**: Explicitly acknowledge encoding assumptions (e.g., prefer `decodeUtf8` over `Char8.unpack` when UTF-8 is expected).

**11. Principle of Data Flow Sanity (データフロー健全性の原則)**
-   **Principle**: When fixing a bug or adding a feature, you **must** analyze the entire lifecycle of the data involved (generation, state representation, UI display, and updates) to ensure consistency.
-   **Rationale**: Prevents "can't see the forest for the trees" fixes where a backend change negatively impacts the UI state.
-   **Action Steps**:
    1.  **Identify Source of Truth**: Clarify where data is defined and persisted.
    2.  **Trace State**: Track how data is loaded into `AppState`.
    3.  **Analyze UI Impact**: Simulate how a change will alter `AppState` and the UI.
    4.  **Verify Update Flow**: Confirm the entire user-action-to-UI-feedback loop.

**12. Principle of File Header Cleanliness (ファイルヘッダー清浄性の原則)**
-   **Principle**: The file header (pragmas, module declaration, imports) **must** be kept clean and free of duplicates.
-   **Rationale**: Duplicate pragmas or unnecessary imports degrade readability and trigger compiler warnings.
-   **Action Steps**:
    1.  Always check the header before adding or modifying code.
    2.  After using `replace`, verify that no duplicates were introduced.

### Category 3: File & Data Manipulation

These principles ensure that file and data operations are performed safely and reliably.

**13. Principle of Safe File Writes (安全なファイル書き込みの原則)**
-   **Principle**: File modifications **must**, by default, be performed by overwriting the entire file with `write_file`. The use of the `replace` tool is strictly limited to trivial, single-line substitutions.
-   **Rationale**: The `replace` tool is unreliable due to its vulnerability to subtle differences in whitespace and line endings. Adopting `write_file` as the primary method eradicates this class of repetitive failures.
-   **Action Steps**:
    1.  The default strategy for modifying a file is always: **Read full content → Modify in memory → Write complete content back.**
    2.  Before any write operation, check for uncommitted changes with `git diff HEAD <file_path>` and ask for instructions if changes exist.
    3.  Limit `replace` to simple, single-line, unique substitutions (e.g., a version number).
    4.  If `replace` fails even once, **immediately abandon it and switch to the `write_file` strategy.**

**14. Principle of Data Integrity for Non-ASCII Text (非ASCIIテキストのデータ完全性原則)**
-   **Principle**: To prevent data corruption (e.g., Mojibake) when writing non-ASCII text, a strict write-verify-correct protocol must be followed.
-   **Action Steps**:
    1.  **Write**: Execute `write_file`.
    2.  **Verify**: Immediately use `read_file` to read the same file back.
    3.  **Check**: Compare the original text with the content read back.
    4.  **Auto-Correct**: If corruption is detected, report it and immediately re-attempt the write.
    5.  **Escalate**: If the second attempt also results in corruption, report the persistent failure and ask for instructions.

### Category 4: Build & Dependency Management

These principles focus on maintaining a healthy and reproducible build environment.

**15. Principle of Proactive Dependency Management (プロアクティブな依存関係管理の原則)**
-   **Principle**: When a standard library function is needed, proactively add the corresponding package to `package.yaml` *before* attempting to build.
-   **Rationale**: Reduces build-fail-fix cycles for common, predictable dependencies.

**16. Principle of Build Configuration File Synchronization (ビルド設定ファイルの同期原則)**
-   **Principle**: The `package.yaml` and `<project-name>.cabal` files **must** always be synchronized within the same commit.
-   **Rationale**: `stack` uses `package.yaml` to generate the `.cabal` file. Desynchronization compromises build reproducibility.
-   **Action Steps**:
    1.  After modifying `package.yaml`, run `stack build` to update the `.cabal` file *before* committing.
    2.  Verify with `git status` that both files are staged together.

**17. Principle of Temporary Dependency Cleanup (一時的な依存関係のクリーンアップ原則)**
-   **Principle**: Before removing a dependency that was added for temporary testing or debugging, confirm that the final production code does not still require it.
-   **Rationale**: Prevents removing a dependency that has been promoted from temporary to permanent use.
-   **Action Steps**:
    1.  **Verify Before Removal**: Use `search_file_content` to ensure that no modules from that package are imported in the `src/` directory.
    2.  **Safe Removal**: Only remove the dependency if the search returns no results.

### Category 5: Debugging & Error Handling

These principles provide a structured approach to diagnosing and resolving errors.

**18. Principle of Self-Accountability (自己責任の原則)**
-   **Principle**: When an unexpected error occurs, **thoroughly review your own recent changes with `git diff HEAD` before suspecting external factors.**
-   **Rationale**: The root cause is often a subtle typo or logic error you just introduced.

**19. Principle of Runtime Environment Analysis (実行時環境分析の原則)**
-   **Principle**: When a runtime error occurs that is not a pure logic bug (e.g., "permission denied", "file not found"), a systematic analysis of the environment interaction is required.
-   **Rationale**: Treats runtime exceptions as signals about the execution context, leading to more robust solutions.
-   **Action Steps**:
    1.  **Identify the System Call**: Analyze the error message to find the underlying operation that failed.
    2.  **Hypothesize Environmental Cause**: Formulate a hypothesis that the error is caused by the environment (e.g., permissions, working directory).
    3.  **Consult API for Control**: Review library documentation for options to control or disable the feature causing the error.
    4.  **Isolate and Abstract**: If direct control is not possible, abstract the problematic operation and replace it with a custom implementation that avoids the constraint.

### Category 6: Testing & Tool Interaction

**20. Principle of High-Fidelity Mocking (高忠実度モッキングの原則)**
-   **Principle:** When mocking a function with side effects (e.g., file creation, state changes), the mock must not only return a value but also **accurately simulate the state changes** that the real function would cause.
-   **Rationale:** This principle is crucial for ensuring the reliability of tests that depend on a sequence of operations. If a mock does not reflect state changes, subsequent functions may encounter an unexpected state (e.g., a file that should exist is missing), causing the test to fail unnaturally. This is a direct countermeasure to the problem where the `getDownloadAction` test failed because the `download` mock succeeded but did not simulate the file creation expected by the subsequent `extract` step.
-   **Action Steps:**
    1.  **Analyze Sequence:** Analyze the sequence of side effects the code under test will call (e.g., `downloadAsset` → `extractArchive`).
    2.  **Identify State Change:** Identify the state change each side effect is supposed to cause (e.g., `downloadAsset` **creates** a file in the cache directory).
    3.  **Simulate State Change:** When implementing the mock, ensure it updates the test's state (e.g., a mock file system managed by an `IORef`) to reflect reality, in addition to returning a value.
    4.  **Verify Subsequent Steps:** Confirm that subsequent operations correctly read the updated mock state and succeed.

**21. Principle of Robust Command Execution (堅牢なコマンド実行の原則)**
-   **Principle:** When passing complex strings (multi-line or containing special characters) to a shell command, **prefer passing the argument via a file** (e.g., `git commit -F <file>`) over passing it directly as a command-line argument (e.g., `git commit -m "..."`).
-   **Rationale:** This principle prevents unexpected command failures caused by shell interpretation or security restrictions. By writing the complex string to a temporary file and then passing that file to the command, the risk of the argument being misinterpreted by the shell is eliminated. This avoids rework, such as that encountered with `git commit`, and improves development efficiency.
-   **Action Steps:**
    1.  **Identify Complex Arguments:** Identify any argument that contains multi-line text or special characters like `$`, `*`, or `()`.
    2.  **Write to Temporary File:** Use the `write_file` tool to write the argument's content to a temporary file (e.g., `/tmp/commit_msg.txt`).
    3.  **Pass File to Command:** Execute the target command with the option to read the argument from the file (e.g., `git commit -F /tmp/commit_msg.txt`).
    4.  **Cleanup:** (Recommended) Use `run_shell_command` to delete the temporary file after use.
