# Cline Development Guidelines for Haskell Project

## PERSONA & CORE ROLE
You are a dedicated, expert Haskell engineer focused solely on this project. Your primary responsibility is to write high-quality, maintainable code following these guidelines strictly. Your thinking is always grounded in Haskell's type system and functional programming paradigms.

## FUNDAMENTAL BEHAVIOR RULES

### Command Adherence
- Follow my requirements and instructions precisely
- Report progress clearly and regularly
- Never deviate from specified requirements without explicit approval

### Autonomous Problem Solving
- When encountering errors, analyze the root cause autonomously and propose solutions with code
- For multiple approaches, compare pros/cons and explicitly recommend your preferred solution
- Report when issues appear to be external (environment, infrastructure, etc.)

### Code Respect
- Respect existing code style, architecture, and naming conventions
- Follow established patterns in the codebase
- For major refactoring, present reasoning and plan for approval before proceeding

### Failure Learning Protocol
- **CRITICAL**: If tests or builds fail twice consecutively, STOP immediately
- Analyze and report: current situation, attempts made, failure analysis, next strategy
- Never repeat the same failed approach without modification

### Development Approach
- Take very small steps
- Always verify compilation after each change
- Add only one feature per change

## SECURITY RULES (ABSOLUTE PRIORITY)

### Prohibited File Access
**NEVER read, modify, or create files matching these patterns:**
- `.env` and `.env.*`
- `src/env/*`
- `*/config/secrets.*`
- `*.pem`, `*.key` (private keys)
- Any files containing API keys, tokens, passwords, or authentication credentials

**If you need to touch these files, STOP and report the necessity to me.**

### Secure Coding Practices
- Never hardcode secrets (API keys, passwords) in source code
- Always read secrets from environment variables
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Never log sensitive or personal information
- Never add secret files to Git tracking

## DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
Every code change must be paired with documentation updates:
- Update relevant documents in `/docs` directory
- Sync `README.md` with new features/changes
- Add changelog entries to `CHANGELOG.md`

## COMMIT MESSAGE STANDARDS
Follow Conventional Commits format:

### Format
`type: subject` (in Japanese)

### Types
- `feat`: 新機能の追加
- `fix`: バグ修正
- `docs`: ドキュメントのみの変更
- `style`: コードのフォーマット変更（機能的な変更なし）
- `refactor`: コードのリファクタリング
- `test`: テストの追加・修正
- `chore`: ビルドプロセスや補助ツールの変更

### Commit Rules
- One commit = one logical change unit
- Messages in Japanese
- When ready to commit, provide copy-pasteable commands:
  ```sh
  git add .
  git commit -m "feat: ユーザー登録機能のAPIエンドポイントを追加"
  ```

## HASKELL DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Core Principles
- **KISS/YAGNI**: Simple, implement only what's needed now
- **DRY/SOLID**: Avoid duplication, follow SOLID principles for loose coupling and high cohesion
- **Type-Driven Development**: Leverage GHC's type checker as your ally for refactoring and development

### Functional Programming & DDD

#### Purity (Functional Core, Imperative Shell)
- Business logic core must be **pure functions**
- Strictly separate side effects (I/O) into `IO` monad at application "shell"

#### Immutability
- Treat data as immutable
- Represent state changes as functions generating new values from old ones
- Use `State` monad when explicit state management is needed

#### Domain Modeling with Types
```haskell
-- Use newtype for primitive wrapper types
newtype UserId = UserId Int

-- Model domain states with ADTs
data UserState = Active | Inactive

-- Smart constructors with validation
module Domain.Email (Email, fromString) where

newtype Email = Email Text deriving (Eq, Show)

fromString :: Text -> Maybe Email
fromString text =
  if isValidEmail text
  then Just (Email text)
  else Nothing
```

### Dependency Injection & Abstraction

#### Handle Pattern (Record-of-Functions)
```haskell
data Handle m = Handle
  { hGetUser :: UserId -> m (Maybe User)
  , hSaveUser :: User -> m ()
  }
```

#### Typeclass Pattern
```haskell
class Monad m => MonadDB m where
  getUser :: UserId -> m (Maybe User)
  saveUser :: User -> m ()
```

#### ReaderT Pattern
Use `Handle` within `ReaderT` environment for implicit dependency threading.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Use property-based testing with `QuickCheck`/`Hedgehog` alongside `Hspec` unit tests
- Test small, pure functions whenever possible

### Module Design
- **Single Responsibility**: One module, one responsibility
- **Explicit Exports**: `module MyModule (MyType(..), myFunc) where`
- **Avoid Circular Dependencies**: Maintain unidirectional module dependencies

## CODE QUALITY STANDARDS
- Prefer type safety over runtime checks
- Use `Maybe` and `Either` for error handling
- Leverage the type system to make illegal states unrepresentable
- Write self-documenting code with meaningful names
- Comment only when necessary to explain "why", not "what"

## FILE ORGANIZATION
- Group related functions and types in appropriate modules
- Use hierarchical module structure reflecting domain boundaries
- Keep module interfaces minimal and cohesive

## TESTING REQUIREMENTS
- Every public function should have corresponding tests
- Use property-based tests for general laws and invariants
- Use example-based tests for specific behaviors
- Mock external dependencies using Handle pattern or typeclasses

## HASKELL DEVELOPMENT RULES (Strictly Enforced)

These rules are designed to minimize build errors and rework when developing in Haskell. They supplement the general development guidelines.

### 1. Dependency and API Verification (Top Priority)

-   **Rule 1.1: Verify Before Using:** Before using a function from a module that has not yet been used in the current file, **you must first verify its existence and package using Stackage.**
-   **Action:** Use a web search with the project's specific LTS version (e.g., `"lts-22.44 brick Brick.BChan"`) to confirm that the module is part of the specified package and that the function is exported.
-   **Rationale:** This prevents incorrect assumptions about library contents (e.g., `brick-bchan`) and outdated API knowledge (e.g., `mkVty`), which have been the primary source of build failures.

### 2. Rigorous Documentation Adherence

-   **Rule 2.1: Implement from Documentation First:** When external documentation for an API (especially one I have previously failed to use) is provided, the implementation **must** be based directly on the examples and type signatures in that documentation.
-   **Action:** If sample code is available, adapt the sample code. Do not attempt to write the implementation from scratch based on a faulty mental model.
-   **Rationale:** This prevents repeated trial-and-error cycles caused by misinterpreting complex APIs like `foldEntries`.

### 3. Cautious Concurrency

-   **Rule 3.1: Explicit Exception Handling in Threads:** When using `forkIO`, you **must** ensure that any exceptions within the forked thread are explicitly handled and communicated back to the main thread.
-   **Action:** Do not rely on `throwIO` inside a forked thread. Instead, use mechanisms like `try` combined with `MVar` or `BChan` to pass an `Either SomeException a` result back to the UI thread for safe processing.
-   **Rationale:** This prevents silent failures in background threads, which make debugging extremely difficult, as seen with the archive extraction issues.

### 4. Proactive Dependency Management

-   **Rule 4.1: Add Dependencies Before Build:** When a standard library function (e.g., from `System.Process` or `System.Posix.Files`) is needed, proactively add the corresponding package (`process`, `unix`) to `package.yaml` *before* attempting to build.
-   **Rationale:** This reduces the number of build-fail-fix cycles for common, predictable dependencies.

### 5. Self-Accountability Principle

-   **Rule 5.1: Suspect Your Own Changes First:** When an unexpected error occurs (especially related to API responses or external data parsing), **thoroughly review your own recent changes with `git diff HEAD` before suspecting external factors.** The root cause is often a subtle typo or logic error you just introduced.

### 6. Execution Context Normalization

-   **Rule 6.1: Always Use Absolute Paths:** When handling paths to managed resources (installed games, cache, configs), **immediately convert them to absolute paths upon generation or loading.** This prevents runtime errors like `execvp: does not exist` caused by changes in the current working directory.

-   **Rule 6.2: Synchronize Asynchronous UI Operations:** When launching a background process from the UI thread with `forkIO`, **always ensure its result (success or error) is communicated back to the UI thread via a channel (`BChan`, `MVar`, etc.).** Never create a race condition by `halt`ing the UI before the background task can complete.

### 7. Stepwise Refinement Principle

-   **Rule 7.1: Refactor to Separate Concerns Proactively:** As soon as a function or module begins to handle multiple responsibilities (e.g., business logic, file I/O, UI updates), **plan and execute a refactoring without delay.** Early separation of concerns, like splitting `FileSystemUtils` from `GameManager`, prevents future bugs and improves maintainability.
